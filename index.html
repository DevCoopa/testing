        <p class="bodyp">A computer analyzes an image in the form of pixels. It does it by considering the image as an array of matrices with the size of the matrix reliant on the image resolution. Put simply, image classification in a computer’s view is the analysis of this statistical data using algorithms. In digital image processing, image classification is done by automatically grouping pixels into specified categories, so-called “classes.” Typically the task of image recognition involves the creation of a neural network that processes the individual pixels of an image. These networks are fed with as many pre-labelled images as we can, in order to “teach” them how to recognize similar images. In other words, the training process "teaches" neurons in the output layer to pay less attention to inputs (which is to say neurons in the middle layer) that push them toward the wrong answer and to pay more attention to inputs that push them in the right direction.</p>

        <p class="bodyp">Computer vision started to take off in the 1960’s. The goal of this field was to speed up and automate the process of analyzing imagery. In 1966, Seymour Papert started a program called the “Summer Vision Project”. During the project he worked with MIT students to attempt to develop new technologies in the computer vision field. The project ultimately ended in failure, however, it is still known by many as the birth of AI-based computer vision. Computers have rapidly improved since the 1960s, “Fast forward to 2010 (and beyond), we have seen an acceleration in improved deep learning techniques and technology. With deep learning, we’re now able to program supercomputers to train themselves, self-improve over time and provide portions of these capabilities to businesses as online applications, like cloud-based apps.” Some innovations of these self taught programs include: security cameras, self driving cars, quality control and more. Using computers to identify objects from pictures or video can be incredibly beneficial as computers are incredibly efficient and require little human supervision.</p>

        <p class="bodyp">Security cameras have improved with the ability to automatically track idle bags and suitcases for airports without being confused or distracted by other activity. Also, Computers can be used to identify and alert when an unrecognized individual is detected. For self-driving cars the computer is able to detect all obstructions in the car’s field of view. The computer also has instantaneous reaction time which, when used in the right way, can make the vehicle incredibly safe. If the car ends up in a dangerous situation it will be able to quickly break faster than a human could.</p>
